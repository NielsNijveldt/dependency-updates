# How Can I Contribute?

# Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for dependency-updates. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report 📝, reproduce the behavior 💻 💻, and find related reports 🔎.

Before creating bug reports, please check the open issues list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. If you can, provide an open source repository as an example or include an example test project in a forked repository.

Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.
